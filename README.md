# python-unittests-example

A simple Python project for introducing unit testing

## Setup

Setup project dependencies running

````pip install -r requirements.txt````


## Content

The project is a helper content to the course presentation. 
It includes example python scripts and an exercise to be completed.


## Exercise

The fizzbuzz() function located in _src/fizzbuzz.py_ file, can be tested by feeding a few different numbers and asserting that the correct response is given for each one. To keep things nicely organized, separate unit tests can be written to test for "Fizz", "Buzz" and "FizzBuzz" numbers.

Pull your repository in your local machine, and complete the test cases in the file _tests/test_fizzbuzz.py_.

Please feel free to add other tests than the ones in the skeleton proposed.

After having completed the task open a Pull Request on the remote repo.
